  "part": "Week 1",
  "objective": "Get a live zsh prompt rendered via wgpu/Metal; input to PTY; minimal VT parsing; smoketest.",
  "tasks": [
    "Create Cargo workspace: crates(core, ui-wgpu), apps/terminal.",
    "Implement EventLoop (winit) + wgpu surface with sRGB format; present every RedrawRequested.",
    "Add `--smoketest` flag that draws 3 frames and exits 0.",
    "Spawn `/bin/zsh` via portable-pty; wrap writer in Arc<Mutex<_>>.",
    "Implement basic keyboard path: ReceivedCharacter + Enter/Backspace/Tab/Esc + arrows.",
    "Integrate vte::Parser with Perform { print, CR, LF, ED(2), CUP } to a simple Grid.",
    "Render grid as monospace text via glyphon/cosmic-text (temporary) and draw a solid cursor.",
    "Resize handling: reconfigure surface + recompute rows/cols + PtySize."
  ],
  "tests": [
    "Unit: feed PTY replay bytes into Grid::advance_bytes → expect prompt substring.",
    "Smoketest: 3 presents within 5s → exit 0.",
    "Input test: programmatically write `echo OK && printf \"\\n\"\\r` on spawn → shows `OK`."
